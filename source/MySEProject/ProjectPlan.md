# Aim
To implement Serialization for HtmClassifier


## Challenges
*  Find the parameters of the Class HtmClassier that needs to implement ISerializable
*  Find which all linked classes need to have a similar implementations.
*  Learn and Implement Unit testing implementations and assertions


## Plan
Sprint 1
*	1. Team formation - Team ALPHA
*	2. Frork neocortexapi , clone locally , build and open solution in Visual Studio
*	3. Analyse and learn how HTMClassifer is implemented and works
*	4. Look into a sample project <a href="https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/tree/master/source/Samples/NeoCortexApiPersistenceSample">NeocortexApiPersistenceSample.</a> for undersatand how serialisation with Spatial Pooler is demonstrated
*	5. Initial branch creations.
*	6. Initial plan commit. Inividual start of work.

Sprint 2
*	1. Implement ISerializable in HTMClassifier class.
*	2. Refer Unit test project <a href="https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/blob/master/source/UnitTestsProject/HTMSerializationTests_P2.cs" </a>
*	3. Start initial code anlaysis.
*	4. Validate the plan and code knowledge with team members and with Professor and Turtors

Sprint 3
*	1. Validate the corecctness of code
*	2. Try adding UT for any relevent codes
*	3. Assert results of serialised parameter values.
*	4. Peer code Review.
*	5. Start wiht documentation.

Sprint 4.
*	1. Completion of all coding .
*	2. Review and final code freeze
*	3. Demo of output
*	4. Completion of Documentation and video.
