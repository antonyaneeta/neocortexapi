Aim

To implement Serialization for HtmClassifier

Challenges

Find the parameters of the Class HtmClassier that needs to implement ISerializable
Find which all linked classes need to have a similar implementations.
Learn and Implement Unit testing implementations and assertions

Plan
Sprint 1

Team formation - Team ALPHA
Frork neocortexapi , clone locally , build and open solution in Visual Studio
Analyse and learn how HTMClassifer is implemented and works
Look into a sample project NeocortexApiPersistenceSample. for undersatand how serialisation with Spatial Pooler is demonstrated
Initial branch creations.
Initial plan commit. Inividual start of work.

Sprint 2

Implement ISerializable in HTMClassifier class.
Refer Unit test project <a href="https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/blob/master/source/UnitTestsProject/HTMSerializationTests_P2.cs"
Start initial code anlaysis.
Validate the plan and code knowledge with team members and with Professor and Turtors

Sprint 3

Validate the corecctness of code
Try adding UT for any relevent codes
Assert results of serialised parameter values.
Peer code Review.
Start wiht documentation.

Sprint 4.

Completion of all coding .
Review and final code freeze
Demo of output
Completion of Documentation and video.
